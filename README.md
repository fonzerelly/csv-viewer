# csv-viewer
A simple csv viewer for the console to train haskell.

You can now scroll through your csv file with the arrow keys:
Up, Down: Row-wise
Left,Right: Column-wise

Any other Key will stop csv-viewer

#createCSVDummy
Writes random csv files to the screen with given rows & cols
createCSVDummy 100 100 > output.csv

Please give me hints how to improve this tiny project and
let me know where I possibly did "Haskell Don't"s.
